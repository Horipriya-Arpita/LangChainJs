It's always a good idea for girls and women to take precautions when traveling or living in any city, such as being aware of their surroundings, avoiding isolated areas at night, and using reputable transportation options.\n\nIn Dhaka, it's recommended to dress modestly and respect local customs to avoid unwanted attention. It's also advisable to travel in groups or with trusted companions, especially at night. Additionally, staying informed about the current safety situation in the city and following any travel advisories can help ensure a safer experience.\n\nWhile Dhaka, like any other city, has its safety concerns, many girls and women live and travel there safely every day.
