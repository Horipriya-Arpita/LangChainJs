Is there anything specific on your mind, or would you like me to tell you a bit about what I can do? I can generate different creative text formats, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc. I will try my best to fulfill all your requirements.\n"

I have no memory of past conversations, and each interaction is a fresh start. So, while we're chatting right now, I don't \"know\" you in the sense of having a stored profile or history of your previous interactions.\n\nThink of it like this: every time you start a new conversation with me, it's like meeting for the first time. You'll have to reintroduce any context or information about yourself that you want me to consider.\n\nI hope that clarifies things! Do you have anything you'd like me to remember about you for this conversation? Perhaps your name, or the topic you're interested in?\n"
